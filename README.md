# hw1
My q1 and q2 answers are in hw1.txt

My code for q4 is in perm.cpp, and q5 is in lists.cpp

Use g++ -g -Wall perm.cpp -o perm to create the executable for q4. Run it with ./perm <string>.

Use g++ -g -Wall lists.cpp -o lists to create the executable for q5. Run it with ./lists <input_file> <output_file>.
